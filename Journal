# Oct 5: started learning MySQL 

# Oct 10: Today I simply imported the data into excel and formated the data to make it cleaner and more readable 
  *Currently I am getting familiar with the data and trying to figure out what kind of analysis I want to do

# Oct 12: Today I was done learning the basics of MySQl, I have decided to use Dbeaver.
- I have also imported all the data, my table is now ready to be analyzed
- made a doc to write down all the prompts I am working on.
